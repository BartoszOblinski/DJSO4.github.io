      <h1>Disc jockey or fun job?</h1>

      <p>
        A <b>disc jockey</b>, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who
        plays recorded music for an audience. Types of DJs include
        <i>radio DJs</i> (who host programs on music radio stations),
        <i>club DJs</i> (who work at a nightclub or music festival),<i
          >mobile DJs</i
        >
        (who are hired to work at public and private events such as weddings,
        parties, or festivals), and <i>turntablists</i> (who use record players,
        usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records).
        Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to shellac and later
        vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to
        also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as
        cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ, controller, or even a
        laptop. DJs may adopt the title "DJ" in front of their real names,
        adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.

        DJs commonly use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of
        recorded music simultaneously. This enables them to blend tracks
        together to create transitions between recordings and develop unique
        mixes of songs. This can involve aligning the beats of the music sources
        so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and enable
        a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized
        DJ mixers, small audio mixers with crossfader and cue functions to blend
        or transition from one song to another.[2][3][4] Mixers are also used to
        pre-listen to sources of recorded music in headphones and adjust
        upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be
        used with a DJ controller device to mix audio files on a computer
        instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a microphone to speak to
        the audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects and
        electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.
